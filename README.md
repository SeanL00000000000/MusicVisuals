# Description of the assignment
Object Oriented Programming group assignment to create an audio visualiser using java processing libraries. 

# Instructions
 Pull from the repo: https://github.com/Gabmeister/MusicVisuals
\MusicVisuals\java\src\c20474596 iterate through these files to access the program
To use this program first press fn+f5 which will run the program then select the C20474596 main.java file to run the program. select through buttons 1-4 to see each pattern created and press space to begin the music.

# How it works


# Conclusion - Learning outcomes, challenges & creativity.
We are most proud of the patterns we had come up with for the visualizers as we believe visually they are quite unique. These were quite difficult to implement and took a while to code but when they began to work we believed they were quite visually striking and worked in beat with the music effectively. The music we picked also added to the creativity as we think it has a good beat to it that the visual effects can effectively display.

 In particular the sphere and cube visual were quite difficult as trying to implement a music based rotation proved quite difficult without the visuals disappearing.
 Other issues arose with the inclusion of new visuals as they would crash the program if not implemented correctly. This was a particular issue with the spiral visual. The spiral visual was the most difficult to implement as it had many properties working together such as the pulsing of the ellipses and the the rotation of the spiral itself. We also had an issue with the patterns not being centered properly this was the result of too many (translate(width/2,length/2)) functions throughout the program. 

Within this project we learned how to incorporate colour changes and beat rotations throughout the visualizer which was knowledge we found very valuable for future projects. We also learned how to create more complex patterns such  as the star visual, spiral and the 3d cube which allowed us to have a better visual experience with more appealing patterns. We learned also how to use different different processing libraries to sufficiently.
